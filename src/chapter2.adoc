== The ACPI RQSC Table

The Capacity and Bandwidth QoS
controllers in a system are described by the ACPI RQSC indexterm:[RQSC]
table. The actual register interface is specified in the RISC-V Capacity
and Bandwidth Controller QoS Register Interface specification cite:[CBQRI].

The RQSC table describes the properties of the QoS controllers in the system.
The table also describes the topological arrangement of the QoS controllers
and resources in the system. The topology is expressed in terms of the location
of the resources within the system and the relation between teh QoS Controller
and the resource it manages.

When QoS is enabled, all QoS Controllers must be configured to
support proper operation.

The table format is described in <<RQSC_TABLE>>.

=== RISC-V Memory Bandwidth QoS Controllers
==== Raw Bandwidth Per Block Calculation
The Memory Bandwidth QoS controllers provide a generic means to control bandwidth
in terms of blocks. The user may be interested in knowing exactly how much raw
bandwidth does a block entail such that they can make informed decisions on how to
size the per RCID bandwidth block configuration.

Given memory bandwidth will vary based on the type of memory connected to the system,
the speed at which they are configured, and the number of channels, interleaving
conditions etc., System BIOS or M-mode FW calculates the amount of Raw Bandwidth
pertaining to each controller's block unit. This is done by calculating the total
bandwidth of all memory controllers within a region (UMA/NUMA node) and then
dividing the total bandwidth by the number of blocks each controller supports.


==== UMA vs. NUMA
A system memory may be configured in UMA (Uniform Memory) mode where all memory
channels in the system across different memory controllers are treated as a
unified memory. In this case, memory traffic is equally shared by all controllers
as the memory addressing is interleaved among all the memory channels.
In this case, typically the SRAT table will either not have any memory
described or it may have memory controllers described with all of them
having the same proximity domain.

In modern systems, the system memory may also be configured in NUMA
(Non-Uniform Memory) mode where specific memory controllers are grouped together
into separate domains and memory addresses are segregrated among different groups
of memory channels managed by specific memory controllers. Within a given NUMA
node however, the traffic is equally shared by all controllers as the memory
addressing is interleaved among all channels that are part of the specific
NUMA node. In this case, typically, the SRAT table will have the memory
controllers described with different proximity domains identifying the
different NUMA nodes they are associated with.

In either case, if there are more than one memory bandwidth QoS controller
specified with the same proximity domain, the bandwidth reservation
configuration settings must be set identical in all the shared QoS controllers.
